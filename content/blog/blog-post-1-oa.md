# The Open Access Revolution: How Gold OA is Transforming Scholarly Publishing in 2025

**TLDR:** Open Access (OA) publishing has reached a tipping point, with Gold OA now accounting for 38% of all scholarly articles globally. Market revenues are projected to grow from $2.1B in 2024 to $3.2B by 2028, driven by institutional mandates and new funding models that are reshaping the academic publishing landscape.

The scholarly publishing ecosystem is experiencing its most significant transformation in decades, with Open Access (OA) emerging as the dominant force reshaping how research is disseminated and accessed globally. Recent data reveals that Gold Open Access has achieved unprecedented growth, increasing from just 11% of global scholarly output in 2013 to 38% in 2023. This remarkable trajectory represents more than statistical growth—it signals a fundamental shift in how the academic community values knowledge accessibility and research impact.

## The Economic Engine of Change

The financial dimensions of this transformation are equally compelling. Open Access journal publishing revenues surged from $1.9 billion in 2023 to $2.1 billion in 2024, with projections indicating continued growth to $3.2 billion by 2028. This economic momentum reflects not just market demand but also the strategic priorities of research institutions and funding agencies worldwide that increasingly require open access compliance for grant recipients.

The dominance of Gold OA over other access models represents a significant departure from traditional publishing economics. Unlike Green OA, which allows authors to self-archive manuscripts in repositories after embargo periods, Gold OA provides immediate, unrestricted access to the final published version. This model has proven particularly attractive to researchers and institutions seeking maximum visibility and impact for their research investments.

## Policy Drivers and Institutional Mandates

The acceleration of OA adoption has been significantly influenced by policy initiatives such as Plan S and Plan U, which mandate open access publishing for publicly funded research. These policies have created a cascading effect, with universities and research institutions worldwide implementing complementary mandates that require their researchers to publish in OA venues or deposit manuscripts in institutional repositories.

The shift toward transformative agreements between institutions and publishers represents another critical development. These agreements are designed to facilitate the transition from subscription-based models to open access while managing costs during the transformation period. Major publishers are increasingly embracing these arrangements as they navigate the changing landscape while maintaining revenue streams.

## Regional Variations and Global Impact

Geographic analysis reveals interesting patterns in OA adoption. Research indicates that the Americas lead in preprint adoption at 27%, while Asia and the MENA region show lower adoption rates at 15% and 17% respectively. These variations reflect different research cultures, funding mechanisms, and institutional priorities across regions, suggesting that the OA transition is not uniform but rather reflects local academic ecosystems.

The global nature of this transition has particular significance for researchers in developing countries, where subscription costs often limit access to scholarly literature. OA publishing democratizes access to research findings, enabling broader participation in global scientific discourse and potentially reducing research disparities between well-funded and resource-constrained institutions.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its growth, the OA movement faces ongoing challenges. Article Processing Charges (APCs) can create new barriers for researchers without institutional funding support, potentially shifting access problems from readers to authors. Additionally, concerns about predatory publishers exploiting the OA model continue to challenge the ecosystem's credibility, with over 18,000 predatory journals identified in recent databases.

The sustainability of various OA business models remains an active area of experimentation. Diamond OA journals, which charge neither readers nor authors, represent one promising approach, though they require sustainable funding mechanisms from institutions or funders. Innovative models are emerging that combine traditional subscription revenues with OA publishing, creating hybrid approaches that serve different stakeholder needs.

## Conclusion

The Open Access revolution represents more than a publishing trend—it embodies a fundamental reimagining of how scholarly knowledge should be created, shared, and valued. As Gold OA continues its rapid growth, the academic community must address remaining challenges while building sustainable systems that serve researchers, institutions, and society. The trajectory toward greater openness appears irreversible, suggesting that the next decade will see continued transformation of scholarly publishing toward more accessible, transparent, and equitable models.
